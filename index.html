    <p style="font-family:verdana" align="justify">On January 30, 2020, the WHO ( World Health Organization) designated the COVID-19 outbreak a worldwide health emergency. COVID-19 was declared as a global pandemic by the WHO on March 11, 2020. Since then Face-to-Face classes have been suspended in most schools. On February 2, 2022, the Department of Education announced that schools under alert level 2 are allowed to commence face-to-face classes for basic education students. The limited face-to-face classes are approved by President Rodrigo Duterte. Most of the schools that are allowed to have limited face-to-face classes are mostly public schools.</p>

            <p style="font-family:verdana">Because the Coronavirus sickness cannot be seen with the naked eye, it is critical to follow the rules in order to reduce the risk of infection, especially given that the country is not fully free of the virus. Following the simple dos and don'ts outlined above can also assist the country in becoming virus-free sooner. It will also limit the danger of people coming into close touch with an infected person, particularly students who are returning to face-to-face classes after taking an online or modular class previously. The implementation of those instructions can also assist students in developing an understanding of the virus and how to avoid becoming infected. These principles can help raise student awareness and influence them to be more cautious and responsible in all actions they take while attending face-to-face school classes.</p>
